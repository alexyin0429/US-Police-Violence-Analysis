# The Average Difference in Death Age Due to Police Violence Between African Americans and Caucasian Americans
Police shooting has turned into a rising social issue, particularly for African Americans. Numbers of literature investigated the relationship between police shooting and various factors(e.g., race, age, income, etc.). However, none of them addresses the connection between death age of police killing victims and personal characteristics. Not only is conflict between blacks and police a troubling social issue, but the fact that more young Americans are dying as a result of police use of force is also an issue that deserves attention. In this study, this social issue is studied by utilizing linear regression methods and supervised machine learning methods. The main finding is that being a black male suspect would be killed by the police use of brutal force 10 years earlier than being a white female suspect. Another finding that both linear regression model and machine learning method yield is that being an armed suspect or a suspect with mental illness would be killed at a later age compared to suspects are not armed or with no mental health issue.
